# Denoise Tool
## Description
Speech denoising is the process of removing unwanted noise from speech signals while preserving the integrity of the speech itself. 
The problem of speech denoising arises when speech signals are corrupted by various types of noise, such as background noise, microphone noise, or electrical interference.

This project aim to denoise signal given input is the noisy signal expected output will give us the denoised signal and evaluate it. The module include 2 methods: Spectral subtraction and FRCRN.

## Prerequisites
To use the FRCNR module, you need to deploy Python environment and install the following modules:
